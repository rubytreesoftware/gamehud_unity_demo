This is a demo project for GAMEhud's Unity wrapper.  It is a very simplistic "Galaga"-like top down shooter that has just enough game to test the GAMEhud interface.

The GAMEhud script files are fully documented.


If you want to play, the controls are:

"a" and "d" OR left arrow and right arrow to move
Space bar to shoot.

The game was inspired by a tutorial from 3dBuzz.com.
